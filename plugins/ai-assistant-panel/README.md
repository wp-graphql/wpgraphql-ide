## Setup

### 1. Get a Gemini API Key

#### Option A: Google AI Studio (Personal Accounts)
1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy the key for the next step

**Note:** If you see "you do not have access to AI Studio", your Google account may be managed by an organization that restricts access. Try Option B below.

#### Option B: Google Cloud Console (Simple API Key)
This method uses the **Generative Language API** with a simple API key (same as Option A but through Cloud Console).

1. Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the **"Generative Language API"** (NOT Vertex AI)
4. Go to "APIs & Services" ‚Üí "Credentials"
5. Create a new **API key**
6. Use this API key in the plugin settings

**Best for:** Development, testing, or when you need a simple API key like Option A but prefer using Cloud Console.

#### Option C: Vertex AI (Enterprise/Production)
This method uses **Vertex AI** with service account authentication (more complex but more powerful).

1. Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create or select a project with **billing enabled** (required for Vertex AI)
3. Enable the **"Vertex AI API"** (different from Generative Language API)
4. Create a Service Account:
   - Go to "IAM & Admin" ‚Üí "Service Accounts"
   - Click "Create Service Account"
   - Name it (e.g., "wpgraphql-ai-assistant")
   - Grant the role "Vertex AI User" or "Vertex AI Administrator"
5. Create and download credentials:
   - Click on your new service account
   - Go to "Keys" tab
   - Click "Add Key" ‚Üí "Create new key"
   - Choose JSON format
   - Download the JSON key file
6. Set up authentication:
   - Option 1: Set environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to the path of your JSON key file
   - Option 2: Upload the JSON file to your WordPress server (secure location) and configure the path in the plugin

**Note:** Vertex AI requires billing to be enabled and has usage-based pricing. It's recommended for production use cases where you need enterprise features like:
- Better rate limits and quotas
- Data residency controls
- VPC Service Controls
- Audit logging
- Model monitoring

#### Option D: Use a Personal Google Account
If your work account is restricted, you can:
1. Sign out and use a personal Gmail account
2. Follow Option A above with your personal account
3. Use that API key in your WordPress installation

### 2. Configure the Plugin
1. Navigate to **GraphQL ‚Üí Settings** in your WordPress admin
2. Click on the **AI Assistant** tab
3. Paste your Gemini API key
4. Save the settings

### 3. Start Using the Assistant
1. Open the GraphQL IDE
2. Click the AI Assistant icon in the activity bar (looks like stacked layers with sparkles)
3. Start chatting with your GraphQL assistant!
